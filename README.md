## 1. Project Introductio
We propose CBPE-Net, a novel deep learning framework for continuous blood pressure estimation. The model integrates cross-scale skip connections (CSSC) to reinforce the fusion of shallow details with deep semantic features, and employs a multi-scale cross-attention mechanism (MSCA) to dynamically guide interactions across different feature scales. Combined with a sliding-window strategy (step size 0.008 s), the model outputs the corresponding instantaneous BP value at each time step, realizing true continuous prediction
- Core Contributions:
  1. By utilizing a single-modality input, our method avoids the inherent issue of SMO associated with multimodal systems, thereby reducing both device complexity, alleviating the operational burden on clinicians, and minimizing potential discomfort for patients.
  2. Moving beyond the limitations of discrete BP prediction, our model provides a real-time, instantaneous BP values. This advancement is critically important for clinical practice, as it facilitates detailed hemodynamic assessment and supports more informed, rapid therapeutic interventions.
  3. With the support of the PIP, the proposed MSCACSSC-UNet model enables accurate and real-time continuousBPmonitoring.Experimentalresultsdemonstrate that the model’s performance meets the AAMI standard and achieves a Grade C rating under the stringent BHS protocol. Furthermore, in comparative assessments, our model consistently outperforms established classical machine learning and contemporary deep learning approaches on all evaluated metrics.
